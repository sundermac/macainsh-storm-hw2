            <p class="lightbox-text">Ponyo, originally named Brunhilde, is a fish-girl and the daughter of the sea wizard Fujimoto and the goddess Granmamare. She lives in her father's underwater home but escapes to the surface world. Ponyo possesses powerful sea magic, which allows her to transform, heal, and manipulate water, often shown as her running on waves. Ponyo's intense desire to be human causes her to use her father's magic so powerfully that she unbalances the entire planet, causing a massive storm and flood.</p>

            <h2 class="lightbox-heading">Sōsuke</h2>
            <p class="lightbox-highlight"><i>"Don't worry, Ponyo. No matter what, I will protect you. I promise."</i></p>
            <p class="lightbox-text">Sōsuke is a five-year-old boy and the son of Lisa and Kōichi. He attends the Himawari Kindergarten and lives in a house on a cliff overlooking the sea. Sōsuke's main traits are his loyalty and responsibility, which he shows when he finds Ponyo and promises to protect her. This promise makes Sōsuke become the key to saving the world; he must pass a test by proving his love for Ponyo is unconditional to restore the planet's balance.</p>

            <h2 class="lightbox-heading">Lisa</h2>
            <p class="lightbox-highlight"><i>"You'll do the right thing. I know it. You're only five, but you're very smart. Sometimes we take a leap. Be brave. You can do it while you can."</i></p>
            <p class="lightbox-text">Lisa is Sōsuke's mother and the wife of the sailor Kōichi. She is a practical, energetic, and brave woman who works at the Himawari Senior Center. Lisa's key trait is her immediate, non-judgmental acceptance; when Sōsuke brings home a girl he claims was a fish, Lisa's main reaction is to make her food and give her a home. Her open-minded nature makes her a safe place for the children, and as a result, when she gets judged by the sea goddess Granmamare, she is seen as a good and worthy human.</p>

            <h2 class="lightbox-heading">Fujimoto</h2>
            <p class="lightbox-highlight"><i>"Try to remember me kindly... if you will. Take care of Ponyo"</i></p>
            <p class="lightbox-text">Fujimoto is Ponyo's father and the husband of Granmamare. He is a wizard who was once human but now lives under the sea, creating an "Elixir of Life" to try to restore the ocean. He has magical abilities, though they are less powerful than his wife's and are often chaotic. Fujimoto's hatred of the polluted human world makes him extremely overprotective of Ponyo. His attempts to forcibly keep her from the surface are what cause her to disobey him and trigger the disaster he was trying to prevent.</p>
